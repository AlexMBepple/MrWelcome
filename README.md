# MrWelcome
Welcome python discord bot. This is a side project that my friend Ryley McRae and I have been working on around school since around 2020. It is an ongoing project as dependencies deteriorate and new features are added. It is a highlight of our discord server and an ongoing project that we are proud of.

# Info
This bot is a welcome bot for discord servers. When a user joins a voice channel Mr.Welcome will also join and play a welcome message that is customizable for each user. 

# Features

Mr.Welcome holds a variety of commands that can be used to customize the bot to your liking. The help command will display all of the commands that are available to the user.

Mr.Welcome has been used over the course of 3 years since its inception and has amassed 170 memes that can be played at any time. The memes are stored in a database and can be added to by the user. 

It is all run off of either Ryley's or my computer and runs in the background on startup.
